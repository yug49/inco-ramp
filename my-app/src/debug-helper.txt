// This is a corrected helper function to add to the Dashboard component

// Original conversion function
// Convert from selected fiat to USD
if (selectedFiat === 'USD') {
  // If the selected currency is USD, no conversion needed
  setUsdEquivalent(fiatAmountNum.toFixed(2));
} else {
  // For other currencies, need to divide by the rate
  // The rate is how many units of foreign currency = 1 USD
  const rate = exchangeRates[selectedFiat];
  console.log(`Converting ${fiatAmountNum} ${selectedFiat} to USD with rate ${rate}`);
  const usdValue = (fiatAmountNum / rate).toFixed(2);
  console.log(`USD equivalent: ${usdValue}`);
  setUsdEquivalent(usdValue);
}

/*
The issue with the conversion function might be with how the ExchangeRate-API works.
The API returns rates in the format 1 USD = X of foreign currency.

For example, if 1 USD = 83 INR, then:
- To convert 100 INR to USD: 100 / 83 = 1.20 USD (which is correct)

Let's check how the API values are structured:
1. The API returns rates with USD as the base currency
2. So a rate of 83 for INR means 1 USD = 83 INR
3. To convert from INR to USD, we divide the INR amount by the rate: INR amount / rate = USD amount

Let's validate if we have any other problems:
1. Make sure we're getting the correct rates from the API - Log them clearly to console
2. Check if the parsing of the fiat amount is working correctly
3. Make sure the UI is displaying the correct value
